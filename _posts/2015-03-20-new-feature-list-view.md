When you share Orbitist maps you'll notice a new 'Info' button in the upper right corner. Click it to toggle to a grid view of the mapped content.

You can use this grid view to see details about the author of the map as well as select other tags created by that user.

Here it is in action:

<div class="wistia-container">
<div id="wistia_ip3nsoqmm1" class="wistia_embed" style="width:640px;height:447px;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js"></script>
<script>
wistiaEmbed = Wistia.embed("ip3nsoqmm1", {
  videoFoam: true
});
</script>
