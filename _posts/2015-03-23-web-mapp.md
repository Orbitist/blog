We work really hard to keep the Orbitist app as clean and simple as possible. But maybe you want more?

Well you're in luck. You can extend Orbitist content to a variety of mapping applications using the 'GeoJson' button!

Here is a crash course in creating maps with Orbitist content, custom [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com) tiles, and amazing [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) data visualizations.

<div class="wistia-container">
<iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/x1ik6eo5ki?videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="640" height="400"></iframe><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js"></script>
</div>

You can download [the source for this boilerplate on Github](https://github.com/Orbitist/mApp-web).

Watch for examples of GeoJson integrations on [our docs page](http://orbitist.com/documentation).
