Dr. Sherri Mason, Professor of Natural Science at the State University of New York at Fredonia, has spent several years surveying the great lakes for plastic.

Her findings show large quantities of small plastic particles known as micro-beads throughout the Great Lakes. The cause of such high numbers of micro-plastics has been linked to everyday cosmetic products.

In the time since the survey came out, several states have banned micro-beads from production.

Below is Sherri's raw data mapped:
