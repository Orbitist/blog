The [East Aurora Advertiser](http://www.mywnynews.com/east_aurora_advertiser/) wanted to create a resource to help visitors to the [East Aurora Music Festival](http://www.eamusicfest.com) find their way around the event.

Using Orbitist, we were able to generate an embeddable map as well as a stand-alone mobile web application that could be shared on social media. The mapping app displayed all the music venues in the town with times and band names. We also outlined shuttle bus routes and bus stops.

In the end, users had easy access to info, multimedia, and driving directions through the map.
