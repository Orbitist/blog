It is far easier today for street art, or graffiti, to be seen across the world. The side of a building tagged in England can quickly gain many more viewers than simply those on the street that day. An image uploaded online has a wider audience, especially if highlighted by the media.

There are many street artists leaving their mark, maybe making a statement in the process, who have received recognition and, possibly, notoriety. This map will seek to plot out some famous images, starting with those by the English man who goes by Banksy.

Some of the street art images have since been removed, covered or altered since their creation.
